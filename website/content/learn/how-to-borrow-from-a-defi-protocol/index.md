# Ultimate Guide on "How Does DeFi Lending Work"

In the world of finance, the age-old practice of secure lending and borrowing has traditionally been the domain of banks and established financial institutions. Whenever individuals required a loan, mortgage, or credit, they instinctively turned to their trusted banks. However, DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, has revolutionized the world of traditional finance.

  

One of the fundamental features of DeFi is borrowing, where users can obtain crypto backed loans by leveraging their cryptocurrency assets as collateral.

  

In this article, we will explain how to borrow from a DeFi protocol. Or skip the steps and get a [crypto loan](https://rocko.co) through Rocko! Let's get to it!

## Step 1: Choosing the Protocol

The first step in borrowing from a DeFi protocol is selecting the right platform. DeFi is a rapidly evolving space with numerous protocols to choose from.

Each DeFi protocol has its own features, interest rates, and flavours (okay, not really flavours, but you get the idea). Research them, read reviews, and find the one that suits your crypto cravings.

When evaluating DeFi protocols, consider factors such as


-   The supported collateral assets and assets you can borrow
    
-   Liquidation threshold and repayment schedule
    
-   The security and reputation of the protocol
    
-   The user interface and experience of the protocol
    

Some of the most popular and reputable protocols are Aave, Compound, and MakerDAO. However, these are just some examples of DeFi protocols that you can use to borrow crypto assets.

## Step 2: Collateral Assets and Assets You Can Borrow

In DeFi lending, collateral plays a pivotal role. So, the next step to borrow from a DeFi protocol is to decide which assets you want to use as collateral.

  

Generally speaking, collateral assets are the ones that you lock up in a smart contract to secure your crypto backed loan. They are usually less stable and more volatile than the loan assets, which are the ones that you receive in exchange for your collateral. For example, you may lock up Ethereum (ETH) as collateral and borrow USDC as a borrowing asset.

  

The main factors that determine which assets you can or want use as collateral and which assets you can or want to borrow are:

  

-   Availability: Not all protocols support all assets. You need to check if the protocol you choose has the asset you want to borrow/use.
    
-   Liquidity: Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be bought or sold in the market without affecting its price. Higher liquidity means lower slippage and lower risk of price fluctuations. You want your collateral asset to have high liquidity so that it can be easily sold in case of liquidation. You also want your borrowing asset to have high liquidity so that you can quickly repay your [crypto loan](https://rocko.co) or swap it for another asset.
    
-   Interest Rate: Interest rate is the cost of borrowing an asset or, when supplying an asset, the return generated. A higher interest rate for borrowed assets means you will incur interest more quickly so you should try to choose an asset with a low-interest rate to reduce your borrowing expense.
    

  

DeFi even allows you to borrow a variety of assets using your crypto as collateral. So, if you've got COMP but want to borrow both USDC and ETH, you can do it using one or multiple lending protocols.

## Step 3: Crypto Loan Terms

The third step is to understand Loan terms.

Crypto loan terms in DeFi are much more flexible than in traditional. For most loans, you get to choose how long you want to borrow the funds. Want a short-term loan to pay down credit card debt? Or a long-term loan for a down payment on a house? DeFi offers both so it's up to you. Additionally, many loans don’t have monthly minimum payment or repayment fees. This means you’re able to repay your loan at any time or quickly refinance to a cheaper rate.

Before taking out a loan, the following are the loan terms you should understand:

  

-   Loan-to-Value Ratio (LTV): LTV is the ratio of the amount of money you borrow to the value of your collateral. For example, if you lock up $100 worth of ETH and borrow $50 worth of USDC, your LTV is 50%. LTV determines how much you can borrow with your collateral. Different protocols have different LTV limits for different assets. Generally speaking, lower LTV means lower risk of liquidation but also lower borrowing power.
    

  

-   Liquidation Threshold: Liquidation threshold is the LTV at which your collateral will be liquidated. For example, if the liquidation threshold for ETH is 75%, your collateral will be liquidated if your LTV meets or exceeds 75%. During liquidation, your collateral will be automatically sold to repay your debt after the protocol charges a fee known as a liquidation penalty. Different protocols have different liquidation thresholds for different assets. Generally speaking, a higher liquidation threshold means the asset is less volatile while a lower liquidation threshold means the asset is more volatile.
    

  

-   Interest Rate: As covered above, interest rate is the cost of borrowing an asset or the return of supplying an asset. Interest rates can be either fixed or floating rate. A fixed interest rate means that the rate is constant and does not change over time. A floating interest rate means that the rate changes periodically based on market conditions. Different protocols have different interest rates for different assets and some offer fixed interest rates for fixed-term loans.
    

  

You should understand the loan terms of the protocol that you choose and make sure that they match your expectations and risk appetite. You should also monitor the market conditions and the protocol parameters regularly to avoid any unpleasant surprises or losses.

## Step 4: floating Interest Rate vs. Fixed Interest Rate

We've touched on this a bit already, but let's dive deeper into the rabbit hole of interest rates.

  

Floating interest rates in DeFi are similar to variable interest rates in traditional finance except that they can change much more often as they are typically based on aggregate borrowing demand.

  

So, one of the most important factors to consider when borrowing from a DeFi protocol is whether to choose a floating rate or a fixed interest rate. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on your preferences and expectations.

  

-   A floating interest rate changes periodically based on market conditions, such as supply and demand of the borrowed asset, volatility, and liquidity. A floating interest rate can be advantageous if you expect the market conditions to improve in your favour, meaning that the interest rate will decrease over time. However, a floating interest rate can also be disadvantageous if you expect the market conditions to worsen against you, meaning that the interest rate will increase over time.
    

  

-   A fixed interest rate does not change over time and remains constant throughout the duration of the loan. A fixed interest rate can be advantageous if you want to have certainty and stability in your payments, regardless of market conditions. However, a fixed interest rate can also work against you if you miss out on potential savings or earnings from changing market conditions. Some protocols offer fixed interest rates with no defined loan term while some require repayment after a specified period.
    

  

The choice between a floating rate or a fixed interest rate depends on your risk appetite, time horizon, and market outlook.

## Step 5: Externally-Owned-Account (i.e. MetaMask)

The final step to borrow from a DeFi protocol is to connect your externally owned account (EOA) to the protocol's website or app.

  

An EOA is a blockchain account that you control with your own private key, which allows you to sign transactions and interact with smart contracts. One of the most popular and user-friendly ways to create and manage an EOA is through MetaMask, a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain applications.

  

MetaMask is a browser extension or mobile app that allows you to store and access your crypto assets, such as Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, as well as connect to various DeFi protocols and web3 applications. With MetaMask, you can easily switch between different networks, such as Ethereum mainnet, testnet, or layer 2 solutions.

  

To use MetaMask, you need to download it from its official website or app store and follow the instructions to create or import your account. You will also need to back up your seed phrase, which is a set of 12 words that can restore your account in case you lose access to it.

  

You can learn more about using MetaMask in our article: How to Create and Use a MetaMask Wallet.

  

Once you have MetaMask installed and set up, you can connect it to any DeFi protocol that supports it by clicking the "Connect Wallet" button on the protocol's website or app.

  

You will then see a pop-up window asking you to confirm the connection request and select which account you want to use. After that, you will be able to see your balance, supply or borrow assets, and monitor your loan status on the protocol's interface.

## Conclusion

Borrowing from a DeFi protocol can be a great way to leverage your crypto assets, access liquidity, hedge against volatility, or take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. However, it also involves certain risks, such as liquidation, smart contract bugs, or regulatory uncertainty.

  

Therefore, it is important to do your own research, understand the terms and conditions of each protocol, and use caution when borrowing.
