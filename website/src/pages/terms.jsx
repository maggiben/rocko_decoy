          the Ethereum network to store and transfer digital assets; (ii) create
          and instruct a smart contract wallet on the Ethereum network (the
          "Rocko Smart Wallet" and together with ; the externally-owned account,
          the "Rocko Wallets" or "Rocko Wallet") and/or certain networks or
          systems built on top of the Ethereum network (Layer 2, Rollup); (iii)
          access and interact with third-party decentralized finance protocols
          that exist on public blockchains such as Ethereum or Ethereum Rollups
          ("DeFi Protocols"); (iv) broadcast transactions generally for the
          purpose of borrowing or repaying funds; (v) access tools such as
          alerts to help manage their loans and (vi); access additional
          functionality as Rocko may add to the App from time to time

          You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Services is subject to
          the Privacy Policy. You further agree that we may collect, use and/or

        <h2>III. Changes to Terms or Services</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify the Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If we do

          methods of communication which we deem reasonable. The modified Terms
          will be effective at the time they are posted on the Site. It's
          important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them because if
          you continue to use the Services after we have modified the Terms, you
          are agreeing to be bound by the modified Terms. If you don't agree to
          be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Services.
          Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or
          discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without
          notice, at our sole discretion.

          fail to comply with the Account registration requirements or these
          terms.

        <h2>VI. Fees</h2>
        <p>
          By using or downloading any of the Services that require payment, you
          agree to pay the applicable fees specified below or within the App,
          which are incorporated herein by reference. We may use a third party
          payment service to bill you through an online account for your fees,
          as applicable, in lieu of directly processing your credit card
          information. By submitting your payment account information, you grant
          us the right to store and process your information with the third
          party payment service, which may change from time to time; you agree
          that we will not be responsible for any failure of the third party to
          adequately protect such information. The processing of payments will
          be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of such third
          party payment service in addition to the terms and conditions of this
          Agreement. You agree that we may change the third party payment
          service and move your information to other service providers that
          encrypt your information using transport layer security (TLS) or
          comparable security technology. Other than as may be expressly set
          forth on our website or in the App, as updated from time to time, we
          will have no obligation to provide refunds or credits but may grant
          them in certain circumstances in our sole discretion.
        </p>

        <h3>A. Service Fees</h3>
        <p>
          By using the Services and finalizing a loan and/or loan increase, you
          understand you are authorizing a transaction from your Rocko Smart
          Wallet to Rocko for the fee to use the Services (Service Fee). The
          Service Fee will be taken out of the amount transferred to your Rocko
          Smart Wallet and will be payable in the same cryptocurrency as the
          collateral for your loan or another cryptocurrency as designated by
          Rocko. To calculate the Service Fee for a transaction, a percentage is
          applied towards the loan amount of the transaction based on the fee
          tier it falls within. Loan amounts will be rounded up to the nearest
          cent. You understand that if you do not pay the Service Fee when due,
          your proposed transaction may fail and you forfeit your right to use
          the Services.
        </p>

        <h4>(i) Service Fee Schedule:</h4>
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>Loan Amount</th>
              <th>Fee Tier</th>
              <th>Percentage</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>$0.01 and above</td>
              <td>1</td>

        </table>

        <p>
          <strong>Fee Waiver:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocko will grant first-time users a limited, revocable,
          non-transferable, and one-time fee waiver on their first $500 in loan
          volume. For avoidance of doubt, any amount of loan volume greater than
          $500 will be subject to the Service Fee Schedule. We may, at our sole
          discretion, from time to time and with or without prior notice to you,
          modify, suspend or disable, temporarily or permanently, this fee
          waiver for any reason whatsoever.
        </p>

        <h4>(ii) Fee Calculation Examples:</h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 1:</strong>
          <br />A first-time user originating a $250 loan would be fully covered
          by the fee waiver --- resulting in no Service Fee being incurred for
          the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 2:</strong>
          <br />A first-time user originating a $20,000 loan would have $19,500
          assessed at 1% --- resulting in a Service Fee of $195 for the
          transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example 3:</strong>
          <br />A user with a current balance of $15,000, wanting to borrow an
          additional $10,000, would have the loan increase of $10,000 assessed
          at 1% --- resulting in a Service Fee of $100 for the transaction.
        </p>

        <h3>B. Network Fees and Other Third-Party Fees</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to the fees described above, you may also incur charges
          and fees from third parties for use of any third party services linked
          to or accessed through the Services. For example, you may be charged
          fees via the decentralized applications that you may access via the
          Services. Additionally, you may incur charges from third parties to
          process transactions on the Ethereum network or any Rollups (commonly
          known as gas fees). You may also incur charges from third parties
          through transferring digital assets from one blockchain network to
          another. Third party fees are not charged by Rocko and are not paid to
          Rocko. Under no circumstances shall Rocko incur any liability of any
          kind to you arising from or relating to fees charged to you by such
          third parties linked to or accessed through the Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, it is your responsibility to ensure you have sufficient
          funds or digital currency in your designated bank account or Rocko
          Wallets to complete any purchases or make other required payments
          using the Services. You are responsible for any non-sufficient funds
          or overdraft fees imposed by third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value-added,
          and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net
          income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental
          authority associated with your use of the Services. Except for income
          taxes levied on us, you: (a) will be solely responsible for reporting
          any tax obligations when, if ever, such obligations arise as a result
          of your use of the Services; (b) will pay or reimburse Rocko for all
          national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any
          jurisdiction, including value added taxes and other taxes as may be
          required, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set,
          services performed, or payments made hereunder, as are now or
          hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state,
          local, or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (c) will not be entitled
          to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties, or assessments from
          payments (including transaction fees) made to us pursuant to this
          Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any other communication from us
          constitutes tax advice, and you are solely responsible for determining
          what, if any, taxes apply to your use of the Services.
        </p>

        <h2>VII. Third-Party DeFi Protocols</h2>
        <p>
          The Services enable you to interact with DeFi Protocols through a
          native frontend software link within the App.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the Services, you understand that you are at no time
          transferring your assets to Rocko or any of its Affiliates and that we
          are not interacting with DeFi Protocols on your behalf. We provide
          access to DeFi Protocols only as a convenience, do not have control
          over their content, and do not recommend, warrant or endorse, and are
          not responsible for the availability or legitimacy of, the content,
          products, services, or assets on or accessible from those DeFi
          Protocols (including any related websites, resources or links
          displayed therein). You are solely responsible for any fees or costs
          associated with accessing DeFi Protocols.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about
          such linked DeFi Protocols, the third parties they are owned and
          operated by, the information contained on them, the suitability of
          their products or services, or the assets they make accessible. You
          acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from
          your use of any DeFi Protocols. DeFi Protocols, such as Compound, may
          provide access to assets which have high risks of illiquidity,
          devaluation, lockup, or loss. Rocko and its affiliates shall not bear
          any liability, whatsoever, for any damage caused by any DeFi Protocols
          or your access to and use of such DeFi Protocols. You should use care
          in linking your Ethereum Wallet or any other wallet with any DeFi
          Protocols or otherwise providing any third parties with access to your
          App.
        </p>

        <h2>VIII. Third-Party Wallet Services</h2>
        <p>
          The Services enable you to create wallets and smart contract wallets
          on the Ethereum network and/or Rollups through third-party wallet
          services ("Wallet Services").
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the Services, you understand that Rocko does not have
          control nor custody of your assets at any time. Additionally, you
          understand that at no time are transferring your assets to Rocko or
          any of its Affiliates.
        </p>
        <p>
          We provide access to Wallet Services only as a convenience, do not
          have control over their content, and do not recommend, warrant or
          endorse, and are not responsible for the availability or legitimacy
          of, the content, products, services, or assets on or accessible from
          those Wallet Services (including any related websites, resources or
          links displayed therein). You are solely responsible for any fees or
          costs associated with accessing Wallet Services.
        </p>
        <p>
          We make no warranties or representations, express or implied, about
          such linked Wallet Services, the third parties they are owned and
          operated by, the information contained on them, the suitability of
          their products or services, or the assets they make accessible. You
          acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from
          your use of any Wallet Services. Rocko and its affiliates shall not
          bear any liability, whatsoever, for any damage caused by any Wallet
          Services or your access to and use of such Wallet Services.

        <h2>XIV. Disclosures; Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>
          Rocko is a developer of software. Rocko is not a bank, financial
          institution, or other lender and does not take custody of digital
          assets. Rocko does not operate a digital asset exchange platform or
          execute peer-to-peer transactions through DeFi Protocols and therefore
          has no oversight, involvement, or control with respect to your
          transactions, which are executed through the Ethereum Blockchain
          and/or a Rollup. DeFi Protocols are autonomous decentralized web
          protocols deployed to public blockchains like the Ethereum Blockchain
          that operate in a disintermediated fashion, and, as such, Rocko does
          not participate in any of these transactions. In each instance, when
          you interact with a DeFi Protocol, you are interacting with a smart
          contract that facilitates loans of digital assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations
          applicable to your transactions, including, but not limited to, the
          Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by
          the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), the federal
          securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S.
          Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and the Bank Secrecy Act
          and the regulation promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Department of
          Treasury Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN").
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand that Rocko is not registered or licensed by the CFTC,
          SEC, FinCEN or any financial regulatory authority. No financial
          regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of Rocko
          software. This website and Rocko software do not constitute advice or
          a recommendation concerning any commodity, security or other asset.
          Rocko is not acting as a loan broker, investment adviser, or commodity
          trading adviser to any person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rocko does not own or control the underlying software protocols that
          enable DeFi Protocols to function. In general, the underlying
          protocols are open source and anyone can use, copy, modify, and
          distribute them. Rocko is not responsible for operation of the
          underlying protocols, and Rocko makes no guarantee of their
          functionality, security, or availability.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Services
          (and any of their content or functionality) provided by or on behalf
          of Rocko are provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, and we
          expressly disclaim, and you hereby waive, any representations,
          conditions or warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
          legal, statutory or otherwise, or arising from statute, otherwise in
          law, course of dealing, or usage of trade, including, without
          limitation, the implied or legal warranties and conditions of
          merchantability, merchantable quality, quality or fitness for a
          particular purpose, title, security, availability, reliability,
          accuracy, quiet enjoyment and non-infringement of third party rights.
          Without limiting the foregoing, we do not represent or warrant that
          the Services (including any data relating thereto) will be
          uninterrupted, available at any particular time or error-free.
          Further, we do not warrant that errors in the Services are correctable
          or will be correctable.

          variety of causes, and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted
          under Applicable Law, we will not be liable for any loss or damage
          caused by denial-of-service attacks, software failures, viruses or
          other technologically harmful materials (including those which may
          infect your computer equipment), protocol changes by third party
          providers, Internet outages, force majeure events or other disasters,
          scheduled or unscheduled maintenance, or other causes either within or
          outside our control.

          The disclaimer of implied warranties contained herein may not apply if
          and to the extent such warranties cannot be excluded or limited under

        </p>

        <h2>XV. Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages</h2>
        <p>
          In no event shall we (together with our Affiliates, including our and
          our Affiliates' respective shareholders, members, directors, officers,
          employees, attorneys, agents, representatives, suppliers or
          contractors) be liable for any incidental, indirect, special,
          punitive, consequential or similar damages or liabilities whatsoever,
          or for any damages for loss of data, information, revenue, goodwill,
          profits or other business or financial benefit arising out of or in
          connection with the Services (and any of their content and
          functionality), any execution or settlement of a transaction, any
          performance or non-performance of the Services, your Ether or Tokens,
          or any other product, service or other item provided by or on behalf
          of Rocko, whether under contract, tort (including negligence), civil
          liability, statute, strict liability, breach of warranties, or under
          any other theory of liability, and whether or not we have been advised
          of, knew of or should have known of the possibility of such damages
          and notwithstanding any failure of the essential purpose of these
          Terms or any limited remedy hereunder nor is Rocko in any way
          responsible for the execution or settlement of transactions between
          users of Rocko software.
        </p>
        <h2>XVI. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, ROCKO AND ITS AFFILIATES
          SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OF ANY TYPE, WHETHER DIRECT OR
          INDIRECT, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO YOUR USE OR
          INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DAMAGES
          ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE COMPROMISE OR LOSS OF YOUR LOGIN
          CREDENTIALS OR FUNDS, OR LOSS OF OR INABILITY TO RESTORE ACCESS FROM

          OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH AUTHORIZED OR
          UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SERVICES, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
          OF ROCKO HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE
          POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

          THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES, APPLICATIONS, OR RESOURCES, INCLUDING RISK OF

          ANY WAY RELATED TO SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND/OR INFORMATION
          OFFERED OR PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AND ACCESSED THROUGH THE APP,

        </p>
        <p>
          WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE
          SERVICES RELY ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS DIGITAL TOKENS AND
          BLOCKCHAINS. BY USING THE SERVICES YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU UNDERSTAND
          THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH USING CRYPTOGRAPHIC AND BLOCKCHAIN-BASED
          TECHNOLOGIES. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ROCKO DOES NOT OPERATE
          ANY BLOCKCHAIN PROTOCOL OR DEFI PROTOCOL, COMMUNICATE OR EXECUTE
          PROTOCOL UPGRADES, OR APPROVE OR PROCESS BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS ON
          YOUR BEHALF. YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE THAT BLOCKCHAIN PROTOCOLS AND

          PARTICIPATING IN THE PROTOCOL MAY RESULT IN LOSSES IF YOUR
          PARTICIPATION VIOLATES CERTAIN PROTOCOL RULES, THAT BLOCKCHAIN-BASED
          TRANSACTIONS ARE IRREVERSIBLE, THAT YOUR PRIVATE KEY AND SECRET

          ANY APPROVALS OR PERMISSIONS YOU PROVIDE BY CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SIGNING
          BLOCKCHAIN MESSAGES OR TRANSACTIONS, ESPECIALLY THOSE RESPONDING TO
          SOLICITATIONS AND OTHER PROMPTS FROM THIRD PARTIES. YOU AGREE THAT THE
          COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE REGULATORY STATUS OR TREATMENT IN
          ANY JURISDICTION OF ANY DIGITAL ASSETS THAT YOU MAY ACCESS OR TRANSACT

          ALL OF THE RISKS OF ACCESSING AND USING THE SERVICES TO INTERACT WITH
          BLOCKCHAIN PROTOCOLS OR DEFI PROTOCOLS.
        </p>
        <p>
          SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
          PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
          LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL ROCKO'S TOTAL
          LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY
          APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY) EXCEED THE AMOUNT
          OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($100.00 USD) OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN THE
          LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.
        </p>
        <h2>XVII. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration</h2>
        <p>
          Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
          arbitrate certain disputes and claims with Rocko and limits the manner
          in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
          arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. In
          addition, arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a
          jury trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          You and Rocko agree that any dispute arising out of or related to
          these Terms or our Services is personal to you and Rocko and that any
          dispute will be resolved solely through individual action, and will
          not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or any other type
          of representative proceeding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except for small claims disputes in which you or Rocko seeks to bring
          an individual action in small claims court located in the county of
          your billing address or disputes in which you or Rocko seeks
          injunctive or other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of
          intellectual property, you and Rocko waive your rights to a jury trial
          and to have any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms or
          our Services resolved in court. Instead, for any dispute or claim that
          you have against Rocko or relating in any way to the Services, you
          agree to first contact Rocko and attempt to resolve the claim
          informally by sending a written notice of your claim ("Notice") to
          Rocko by email at support@rocko.co or by certified mail addressed to
          767 Broadway #1294, Manhattan, NY 10003. The Notice must (a) include
          your name, residence address, email address, and telephone number; (b)
          describe the nature and basis of the claim; and (c) set forth the
          specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be similar in form to
          that described above. If you and Rocko cannot reach an agreement to
          resolve the claim within thirty (30) days after such Notice is
          received, then either party may submit the dispute to binding
          arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the limited circumstances
          set forth above, in court. All disputes submitted to JAMS will be
          resolved through confidential, binding arbitration before one
          arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be held in New York City, New
          York, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and
          Procedures ("JAMS Rules"). The most recent version of the JAMS Rules
          are available on the JAMS website and are hereby incorporated by
          reference. You either acknowledge and agree that you have read and
          understand the JAMS Rules or waive your opportunity to read the JAMS
          Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS Rules are unfair or should not
          apply for any reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          You and Rocko agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
          that the enforceability of this Section 12 will be substantively and
          procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et
          seq. (the "FAA"), to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
          As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator
          will have exclusive authority to make all procedural and substantive
          decisions regarding any dispute and to grant any remedy that would
          otherwise be available in court, including the power to determine the
          question of arbitrability. The arbitrator may conduct only an
          individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one
          individual's claims, preside over any type of class or representative
          proceeding or preside over any proceeding involving more than one
          individual.
        </p>

        <p>
          The arbitrator, Rocko, and you will maintain the confidentiality of
          any arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including, but not
          limited to, all information gathered, prepared and presented for
          purposes of the arbitration or related to the dispute(s) therein. The
          arbitrator will have the authority to make appropriate rulings to
          safeguard confidentiality, unless the law provides to the contrary.
          The duty of confidentiality does not apply to the extent that
          disclosure is necessary to prepare for or conduct the arbitration
          hearing on the merits, in connection with a court application for a
          preliminary remedy or in connection with a judicial challenge to an
          arbitration award or its enforcement, or to the extent that disclosure
          is otherwise required by law or judicial decision.
        </p>

        <p>
          You and Rocko agree that for any arbitration you initiate, you will
          pay the filing fee and Rocko will pay the remaining JAMS fees and
          costs. For any arbitration initiated by Rocko, Rocko will pay all JAMS
          fees and costs. You and Rocko agree that the state or federal courts
          of the State of New York and the United States sitting in New York
          City, New York have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the
          enforcement of an arbitration award.
        </p>

        <p>
          Any claim arising out of or related to these Terms or our Services
          must be filed within one year after such claim arose; otherwise, the
          claim is permanently barred, which means that you and Rocko will not
          have the right to assert the claim.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within 30 days of
          the date you first accepted the terms of this Section by emailing us
          at support@rocko.co. In order to be effective, the opt-out notice must
          include your full name and address and clearly indicate your intent to
          opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of binding arbitration,
          you are agreeing to resolve disputes in accordance with this Section.
        </p>

        <p>
          If any portion of this Section is found to be unenforceable or
          unlawful for any reason, (a) the unenforceable or unlawful provision
          shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the unenforceable
          or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder
          of this Section 12 or the parties' ability to compel arbitration of
          any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to this Section;
          and (c) to the extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a
          class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such claims
          must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not
          in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
          shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual claims in
          arbitration. Further, if any part of this Section is found to prohibit
          an individual claim seeking public injunctive relief, that provision
          will have no effect to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought
          out of arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be
          enforceable.
        </p>
        <h2>XVIII. MISCELLANEOUS</h2>
        <p>
          This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any
          principles of conflicts of law. You agree that any action at law or in
          equity arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services
          that is not subject to arbitration under the Dispute Resolution and
          Arbitration section above shall be filed only in the state or federal
          courts in New York City, New York and you hereby consent and submit to
          the personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purposes of
          litigating any such action. Any right or remedy of Rocko set forth in
          these Terms is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other right or
          remedy whether described in these Terms, under applicable law, at law
          or in equity. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or
          privilege under these Terms shall not operate as a waiver thereof. The
          invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of
          which shall remain in full force and effect. We will have no
          responsibility or liability for any failure or delay in performance of
          the website or App or any of the Services, or any loss or damage that
          you may incur, due to any circumstance or event beyond our control,
          including without limitation any flood, extraordinary weather
          conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection,
          riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications,
          power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. You may not
          assign or transfer any right to use the App or the Services, or any of
          your rights or obligations under these Terms, without our express
          prior written consent, including by operation of law or in connection
          with any change of control. We may assign or transfer any or all of
          our rights or obligations under these Terms, in whole or in part,
          without notice or obtaining your consent or approval. Headings of
          sections are for convenience only and shall not be used to limit or
          construe such sections. These Terms contain the entire agreement and
          supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the
          parties regarding the App and the Services. In the event of any
          conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with
          us, these Terms will control unless the other agreement specifically
          identifies these Terms and declares that the other agreement
          supersedes these Terms.
