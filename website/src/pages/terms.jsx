                            will make a decision in writing, but need not
                            provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
                            either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable
                            law, and any award may be challenged if the
                            arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise
                            required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
                            law, the arbitration will take place in&nbsp;New

                            herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel
                            arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration,
                            or to confirm, modify, vacate, or
